	<hr>

	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Mini Hatch (stylized as MINI hatch, or MINI Hardtop in the US), also known as Mini Cooper, Mini One, or simply the Mini, is a three-door hatchback first introduced in late 2000, with a second generation launched in 2006 and a third generation model launched in 2014. A convertible version was introduced in 2004, with the second generation following in 2008. The Mini is produced in Cowley, Oxfordshire, UK, at Plant Oxford, and, since July 2014, at VDL Nedcar in Born, Netherlands.[1] The mini convertible is, since 2015, only assembled in The Netherlands. The Mini Hatch was the first model launched by BMW under the Mini marque after the original Mini was discontinued in 2000. The new model built by BMW is technically unrelated to the former.</h4>
