	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Volkswagen Karmann Ghia is a sports car marketed in 2+2 coupe (1955–1974) and convertible (1957–1974) body styles by Volkswagen. Internally designated the Typ 14, the Karmann Ghia combined the chassis and mechanicals of the Type 1 (Beetle) with styling by Luigi Segre of the Italian carrozzeria Ghia and hand-built bodywork by the German coach-builder Karmann. From 1962-1969, Volkswagen marketed the Typ 34, with angular bodywork and based on the Type 3 platform and mechanicals. More than 445,000[3] Karmann Ghias were produced in Germany over the car's production life, not including the Type 34 variant. Karmann Ghia Brazil produced 41,600 cars locally for South America between 1962 and 1975. American industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague included the Type 14 Karmann Ghia in his list of the world's most beautifully designed products. </h4>
