	<hr>

	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Ford Bronco is a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV, predating the term SUV) manufactured and marketed by Ford from 1966 to 1996, over five generations of vehicles. Ford announced plans to reintroduce the Bronco in 2020 at the North American International Car Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 2017. The Bronco was introduced in 1966 as a competitor to the small four-wheel-drive compact SUVs that included the Jeep CJ-5 and International Harvester Scout; it was built on its own platform. A major redesign in 1978 enlarged the Bronco, using a shortened Ford F-Series truck chassis to compete with the similarly adapted Chevy K5 Blazer and the Dodge Ramcharger. Most Broncos are equipped with a swing-away spare tire carrier on the outside of the rear door. The model is most famous for its appearance in the widely broadcast car chase of O.J. Simpson. Al Cowlings drove the vehicle as the former running back sat in the backseat, threatening to kill himself. From 1966 to 1996, Broncos were produced at Ford's Michigan Truck Plant in Wayne, Michigan. After years of rumors, Ford announced that the Bronco would return for the 2020 model year, made in its former assembly plant. </h4>
