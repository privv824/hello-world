	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The actual car was a originally a dilapidated, white 1948 Ford De Luxe Convertible. Its windshield was cracked and held together with tape, the right headlight was out, the tires were mismatched without hubcaps, and it was in need of a new coat of paint.By the time it was ready for the race at Thunder Road, it looked almost completely spruced up. The windshield, headlights, and bumpers were all replaced, a new antenna was added, and the tires were all matching white walls with new chrome hubcaps. It was given a new coat of white paint, with added silver lightning bolts outlined in red. After the race, the side of the car torn by the spurs on the hubcaps of Leo's car. It was also dirtied, having splashed into the murky water, but still mostly intact, even more so than when Kenickie bought it. The fantasy version of the car was a 1948 Ford Convertible in Kandy Red finish with white lightning bolts. It had a transparent plexiglass hood, with added fenders in the back and matching firestone tires with matching hubcaps. This version of the car was won by Danny at the school's graduation carnival, which he and Sandy departed in. In Grease live, the car is completed with Red Paint, Lightning Bolt Decals, and even a turbo jet, which allows Danny to win the race.</h4>
