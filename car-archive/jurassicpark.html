	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Jeep Wrangler is a series of compact and mid-size (Wrangler Unlimited and Wrangler 4-door JL) four-wheel drive off-road vehicle models, manufactured by Jeep since 1986, and currently migrating from its third into its fourth generation. The Wrangler JL was unveiled in late 2017 and will be produced at Jeep's Toledo Complex. The Wrangler is arguably an indirect progression from the World War II Jeep, through the CJ (Civilian Jeeps) produced by Willys, Kaiser-Jeep and American Motors Corporation (AMC) from the mid-1940s through 1980s. Neither AMC nor Chrysler (after it purchased AMC in 1987) have claimed that the Wrangler was a direct descendant of the original military model. Nevertheless, just like the Willys MB and the CJ Jeeps before it, all Wrangler models continue to use a separate body and frame, rigid live axles both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, a fold-flat windshield, and can be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they have part-time four-wheel drive systems, with the choice of high and low gearing, and standard are open bodies with removable hard- or soft-tops. However, the Wrangler series was designed to be more comfortable on-road in an attempt to attract more daily drivers,[1] by upgrading its suspension, drivetrain, and interior, compared to the CJ line. Specifically, the suspension on all Wranglers benefits from the addition of trackbars and anti-roll bars, and from the 1996 TJ onwards also from coil-springs instead of leaf-springs. Since 2004 long-wheelbase versions have been available under the name Wrangler Unlimited. Initially the Unlimited was a two door model, but since 2006 it has been offered as a four-door model.</h4>
