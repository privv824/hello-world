	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Jeep CJ models are both a series and a range of small, open-bodied off-road vehicles and compact pickup trucks, built and sold by several successive incarnations of the Jeep automobile marque from 1945 to 1986. In 1944 Willys-Overland, one of the two main manufacturers of the World War II military Jeep, built the first prototypes for a commercial version â€“ the CJ, short for civilian Jeep.[2] From then on all CJ Jeeps consistently had a separate body and frame, rigid live axles with leaf-springs both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, a fold-flat windshield, and could be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they had part-time four-wheel drive systems, with the choice of high and low gearing, and open bodies with removable hard- or soft-tops. After remaining in production through a range of model numbers, and several corporate parents, the Jeep CJ line was officially ended in 1986. More than 1.5 million CJ Jeeps were built, having continued the same basic body style for 45 years since the jeep first appeared.[1] Widely regarded as "America's workhorse," the CJs have been described as "probably the most successful utility vehicle ever made."[3] American Motors VP Joseph Cappy said the end of "CJ production will signal an end of a very important era in Jeep history."[4] The Jeep CJ-7 was replaced in 1986 by the similar-looking Jeep Wrangler, as well as the Jeep CJ-8 and CJ-10 were succeeded by the Jeep Comanche pickup.</h4>
