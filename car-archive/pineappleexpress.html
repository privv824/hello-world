	<hr>

	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Cadillac Brougham was a line of luxury cars manufactured by the Cadillac Motor Car Division of General Motors from the 1987 through 1992 model years and was previously sold from 1977 to 1986 as the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. The optional "d'Elegance" trim package introduced during the Fleetwood era remained available. The model received a major facelift in 1990. Originally used for a single horse drawn enclosed carriage for 2-4 people, the “Brougham” owes its name to British statesman, Henry Brougham.[1] Cadillac first used the name in 1916 to designate an enclosed 5-7 passenger sedan body style.[1][2][3] In the thirties, the name was given to a formal body style with open chauffeur compartment and enclosed rear quarters, metal roof and often "razor-edged" styling.[1] When Cadillac started offering Fleetwood bodies on some of its cars in 1925, the Brougham body style was Fleetwood bodied every year with the exception of 1926.[2][3] After 1937 the Brougham name was not applied to any Cadillac for the remainder of the pre-World War II period.</h4>
