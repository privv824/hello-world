	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Chrysler PT Cruiser is a front-engine, front-wheel drive, small family car/Compact MPV manufactured and marketed internationally by Chrysler in 5-door hatchback (2000–2010) and 2-door convertible (2005-2008) body styles. The PT Cruiser is noted for its exterior design reminiscent of 1930s styling, executed by Bryan Nesbitt,[1] and its interior design featuring a high-roof, high h-point seating, and flexible cargo and passenger configurations — a multi-level cargo shelf as well as fold, tumble and removable rear seating. Originally conceived as a Plymouth model, the PT Cruiser was ultimately marketed as a Chrysler model, after retirement of the Plymouth brand. By the end of production in July 2010,[2] worldwide production had reached 1.35 million. Internally at Chrysler during development, "PT" stood for "Plymouth Truck", as it was intended to be a Plymouth model, and certified as a truck by NHTSA standards. The name stuck, but Chrysler never revealed what PT was supposed to mean.</h4>
