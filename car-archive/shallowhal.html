	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is a compact sport utility vehicle that was manufactured and marketed by Jeep from 1983 to 2001. Sharing the name of the original full-size SJ model, but without a traditional body-on-frame chassis, the XJ instead featured a light-weight unibody design,[2] The models were originally marketed as Sportwagons and became the precursor to the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV) as that term was not yet in use. The XJ spawned competitors as other automakers began to notice that this Jeep design began replacing regular cars.[5] It also began to supplant the role of the station wagon and "transformed from truck to limousine in the eyes of countless suburban owners."[6] The XJ is a "significant link in the evolution of the 4x4." Built in Toledo, Ohio, USA; Beijing, China; Ferreyra, Argentina; Cairo, Egypt; and in Valencia, Venezuela, the XJ provided the mechanical basis for the MJ-series Jeep Comanche pickup truck. Automotive journalist Robert Cumberford, writing for Automobile, called the Jeep XJ one of the 20 greatest cars of all time â€” for its design, and "possibly the best SUV shape of all time, it is the paradigmatic model to which other designers have since aspired".[6] The XJ was also selected in 2011 as one of "10 cars that refuse to die" by Kiplinger.</h4>
