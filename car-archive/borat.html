	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Volkswagen New Beetle is a compact car, introduced by Volkswagen in 1997, drawing heavy inspiration from the exterior design of the original Beetle. Unlike the original Beetle, the New Beetle has its engine in the front, driving the front wheels, with luggage storage in the rear. Many special editions have been released, such as the Malibu Barbie New Beetle.[1] In May 2010, Volkswagen announced that production of the current body of the New Beetle would cease in 2011. In 2011 for the 2012 model-year, a new Beetle model, the Beetle (A5), replaced the New Beetle. It is often referred to as the New Beetle as well.</h4>
