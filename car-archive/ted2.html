	<hr>

	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Dodge Dart is a transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive, four-door compact sedan manufactured and marketed by FCA US LLC, a subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The automobile made its debut at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. The Dart uses a modified variant of the Fiat Compact Platform,[6] shared with the Alfa Romeo Giulietta, widened by 1.5 in (38 mm) and lengthened by 3.7 in (94 mm) to its wheelbase â€” creating the Compact U.S. Wide (CUSW) platform. The modified platform, adapted to U.S. requirements and subsequently redesignated the PF platform, was designed over approximately 18 months at a cost of US $1 billion. Resurrecting a nameplate used by Dodge for model years 1960-1976 for a succession of full-size, mid-size and finally compact models, the Dart (PF) was the brand's first compact sedan since 2005, when the Neon was discontinued.</h4>
