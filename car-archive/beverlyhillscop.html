	<hr>

	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Mercury Marquis was a luxury model line produced by the Mercury division of Ford Motor Company from 1967 to 1986. It was marketed for several generations as the Mercury counterpart of the upscale full-size Ford LTD). In 1983, the Marquis became Mercury's mid-size car, supplanted by the full-size Grand Marquis as the highest trim level of the Marquis in the Mercury product line. As Ford Motor Company adopted front-wheel drive cars during the 1980s, the Marquis was phased out after the 1986 model year; it was replaced by the Mercury Sable, the upscale version of the Ford Taurus. A "Marquis" is historic French title, equivalent in nobility to the English marquess in the British peerage</h4>
