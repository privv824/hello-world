	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The Millennium Falcon is a fictional starship in the Star Wars franchise. The modified YT-1300 Corellian light freighter is primarily commanded by Corellian smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Wookiee first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Designed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation (CEC), the highly modified YT-1300 is reliable, durable, modular, and is stated as being the second-fastest vessel in the Star Wars canon. The Millennium Falcon first appears in Star Wars (1977), and subsequently in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), The Force Awakens (2015), and The Last Jedi (2017). The ship also makes a brief cameo appearance in Revenge of the Sith (2005), as it approaches the Senate Building on Coruscant. Additionally, the Falcon appears in a variety of Star Wars expanded universe materials, including books, comics, and games; James Luceno's novel Millennium Falcon focuses on the titular ship.[1] It also appears in the 2014 animated film The Lego Movie in Lego form, with Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels reprising their roles of Lando Calrissian and C-3PO, and with Keith Ferguson voicing Han Solo. </h4>
