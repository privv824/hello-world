	<h4 align="center" style="color:white"> About:  The BMW E32 is the second generation of the BMW 7 Series luxury cars and was produced from 1986 to 1994. It replaced the E23 and was initially available with a straight-six or V12 engine. In 1992, V8 engines became available. In 1994, the E32 was replaced by the E38. The E32 introduced the following features for the first time in a BMW: Electronic Damper Control,[9] V12 and V8 engines, double glazing, the CAN bus electronic protocol,[10] Xenon headlamps,[11] traction control[12] and dual-zone climate control.[13] The E32 750i was the first car adhering to BMW's self-imposed speed limit of 250 km/h (155 mph).[14] The 'iL' models were the first time that a long-wheelbase option was offered by BMW.</h4>
